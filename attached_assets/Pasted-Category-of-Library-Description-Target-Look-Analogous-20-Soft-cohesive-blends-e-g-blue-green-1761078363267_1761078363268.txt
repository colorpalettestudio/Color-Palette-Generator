Category	% of Library	Description / Target Look
Analogous	20%	Soft, cohesive blends (e.g. blue-green-teal)
Complementary	20%	Contrast-driven (e.g. purple + yellow)
Triadic	20%	Balanced variety (e.g. red + blue + yellow)
Split-Complementary	10%	Two contrasts, one anchor
Tetradic (4-color schemes)	10%	Complex, vibrant mixes
Neutral-Focused / Earthy	10%	Muted browns, creams, grays
Bright Pop / Modern Vibrant	10%	Gen Z energy — pinks, teals, limes

That distribution ensures every “type” of designer can find something.

⚙️ Step 3. Algorithmic Rules (for your dev)

When generating each palette:

Pick a base hue (random across 0–360° on HSL).

Randomly choose a color harmony type (weighted by the distribution above).

Generate remaining colors by applying hue shifts + saturation/lightness adjustments according to that harmony.

Analogous: ±20–40° hue shift

Complementary: +180° hue

Split-Complementary: +150° and +210° hue

Triadic: ±120° hue

Tetradic: +90°, +180°, +270° hue

Apply saturation/lightness variety:
For each color, randomize saturation ±20% and lightness ±15%.
→ ensures depth within palette (not all mid-tones).

Inject neutral logic:
Replace 1 color in every 2 palettes with a neutral variant (light gray, taupe, cream, dark charcoal).
→ keeps palettes usable.

🧠 Step 4. Style Tags (optional but smart)

For UX and filtering later, tag each palette with simple mood categories:

Warm, Cool, Neutral, Vibrant, Soft, Retro, Earthy, Pastel, Bold, Minimalist, Futuristic, Sunset, Natural…

You can auto-assign tags based on hue/saturation values:

If avg saturation > 70 → Vibrant

If hue cluster < 90° → Warm

If lightness range < 20 → Minimalist

This makes browsing more “Pinterest-like.”

🌈 Step 5. Manual Curation Pass (final polish)

After generation, quickly curate the top 80% visually — delete ones that:

Are overly dark or overly light

Have 3+ similar tones

Contain unreadable contrast combinations

You’ll end up with about 80–85 top-tier palettes, and can manually fill the last 10–15 with human-made aesthetic palettes (like “Sunset Glow,” “Midnight Garden,” etc.) to anchor your brand aesthetic inside the mix.
